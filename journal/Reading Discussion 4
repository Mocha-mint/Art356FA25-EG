Norman writes on how often we are given to blame just ‘human error’ towards many design faults, not often taking that time to ask why did the human make this error? Their line, ‘why does the root cause analysis stop as soon as a human error is found? If a machine stops working, we don’t stop the analysis when we discover a broken part. Instead, we ask: “Why did the part break?’, I think best showcases this mindset, fundamentally that human error was one part of a broken process. Something led to the particulars of their thoughts, their actions to make that error, and it was probably something about the design.

As they further speak on voluntary mistakes, I am made to reflect upon tolerance for failure. Many designs are made by early artists that forget, people just like them make mistakes. By reinforcing designs against slips and mistakes, we make them truly great. Putting aside mere accidents, people will push the limits of a design, whether to save time or mere desire. And thus, the design must work to meet that desire.
