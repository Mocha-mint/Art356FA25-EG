Constraints are an interesting topic to me as a game designer, often I find people complaining about features 'absent' or wish for things that would undermine the intended design goal. An example I like from the book that has become true overtime is on page 127, is in reference to keys used for cars. Keys are a fundamental physical restraint put upon the entry or use of certain items, but what I like is how Norman points out the 'actual' goal is to merely ensure only authorized users utilize something. For as much as we could redesign keys, we can also explore new design space to achieve that purpose, like how some cars will connect wirelessly to keys meaning you never have to pull it out. In other words, the key is a glorified nfc chip in this situation.

When thinking back to my craft, constraints and affordances work hand in hand to achieve our desired behavior. A game whose example I continue to remember is Mark of the Ninja, which deliberately stripped away more elaborate direct combat options after playtesting. After all, by offering the players good and satisfying tools for this situation, we encourage people to not push themselves to really learn stealth and instead just fight out of situations. By constraining that direct ability, we force the user into instead focus upon stealth's perfection.
