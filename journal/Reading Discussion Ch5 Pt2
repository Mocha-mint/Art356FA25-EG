As the direct follow-up to earlier in the chapter, Norman writes on how often people simply don’t wish to report error. Thanks to our earlier concept of stigmatized blaming upon the individual, in many cultures people will just ignore problems. Finding ways to improve mere reporting of issues is a critical step in development. Additionally, working with measures like ‘poke-yoke’ techniques to mitigate even minor error offers a quality of life that signifies polish.

In consideration to my own work, I find games must strike a careful balance. Or perhaps, your error prevention must be transparent. Buffering is one form, but overwhelming tutorial will frustrate. This is perhaps the best place for a setting, ‘how blatant do you want it?’. The people who care about these things, and who look into settings in their games line up quite well.
