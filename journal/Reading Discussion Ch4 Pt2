Norman writes on the power of convention to guide understanding, and in reading this chapter it truly dawned just how deep that rabbit hole truly goes. I have heard of these concepts in isolation, but put them together now, such as how many cars introduce ‘false’ engine noises as noted in the chapter, or as i’ve noticed vacuums. These elements don’t necessarily exist to improve them in a conventional way, but match what countless users just ‘expect’.

Thinking towards my own craft, perhaps the most striking example is button layout. Without a doubt, the most common feedback I receive on my game development projects relates to merely the controls. With slight variation across major consoles and a wider range on PC, there a lot to account for when resolving conventions.
